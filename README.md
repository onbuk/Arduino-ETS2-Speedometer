ARDUINO ETS2 SPEEDOMETER

This is a arduino-based custom speedometer for Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator.

It uses data from Funbit's telemetry server, which you can download here: https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server

To replicate this project, you should have these:
- Arduino Uno (Most of them should work, its just the one I used.)
- 2 Servo motors (Or any number depending on how much gauges you are making)

I made mine using 3D printed parts and I printed the background on my inkjet printer. I also used a 8 screws and nuts, but I encourage you to modify the design for your own screws. 

In the 3D_Print folder, you will find:
- The STLs I used
- The .STEP to make your own
